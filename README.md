* Generated file will be automatically deleted.
* The remaining and the remaining space, these are the spaces that are left after the files are deleted and need to be cleaned up.

## Scenario:

* Let's say you leave a company and you have some personal data on your computer that you don't want others to see.
* After deleting it, run the software again to prevent the data from being restored and viewed by others.
* If you don't want your computer anymore and want to sell it to others second-hand, then after deleting your personal data, run this software to prevent your data from being recovered by others.
* Some confidential files have been saved on your computer, and if you want to delete them completely, then delete them and then run this software.
